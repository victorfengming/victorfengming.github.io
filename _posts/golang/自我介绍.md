Hello, I am glad to introduce myself. My name is Yu Fengming and Now I am twenty two years old. I am a positive sunny boy。 Now，I currently live in Shenyang, Liaoning Province. I will graduate from Shenyangligong University in July two thousand and twenty with a major in Electronic Science and Technology. 

While in college, I have good grades in basic courses about programming。In our class, I am the commissary in charge of studies。
I used to receive a school scholarship twice。I am very like computer programming and am interested in the IT industry. I think coding is a special art and enjoy the process。

During my college years, I learned c language and object-oriented programming。
I used to train python in IT lampbrother and taught myself Java. For web development，I can use python, django, flask and so on. 

I am familiar with the use of MySQL database and redis database. On the front end I master JavaScript, sass, Vue, and bootstrap. I have used django and vue for some projects. I also have written some spider for web pages in python。I really enjoyed working on the project。

My advantage is that my executive ability is relatively strong, I do things very patient. I don't like to do the same thing over and over again。I have strong self-learning ability, and I like diverse and challenging work。

I may not be good at expressing myself, and I may not be confident。
I intend to work in Beijing. For your company, I wish I can realize my dream in here. Please give me a chance, thank you
